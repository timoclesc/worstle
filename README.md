A clone of the popular game "Wordle".
I built this because it seemed like a fun project to take on that could be completed in a relatively short amount of time, not to mention I love playing the Wordle every day!

Something I wanted to commit to on this was really using TailwindCSS for the entire project. I had played around with it in the past, but had never worked enough with it on a project to really get a deep understanding of it. Using Tailwind on this project was a fun experience, and allowed me to hit those little "hurdles" that you need to overcome before really getting good at using a tool.

This was a really fun project and I definitely encourage it for anyone that's looking for something fun and simple to work on. The official "Wordle" game uses React, Redux, and localStorage to persist state locally, so it's really easy to reverse engineer and see exactly how it's built just by using your browser's devtools!

A big inspiration for building this was [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesQQuick) speaking about his experience building a Wordle clone in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) this on he and [Amy Dutton's](https://selfteach.me/) podcast, [Compressed FM](https://www.compressed.fm/).
